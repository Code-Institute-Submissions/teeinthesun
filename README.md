# Tee in the Sun - a Golfing holiday home rental website

## Overview
The purpose of this website is to advertise a holiday townhouse for rental on a golf resort. I have created this website to demonstrate the skills I have obtained from Stream One of the Full Stack Web Developer course

## Features

- Tables to display pricing options
- Booking form with validation
- Links to social media
- Lightbox image pop-ups

## Technology

The technologies that I have used to build this site are:
 - HTML5 for the structure of the website elements
 - CSS3 for styling of the components
 - CSS Grid for the layout of the website
 - Bootstrap to give the website a responsive layout
 - JQuery and Javascript to enable the lightbox feature on the images and to change the colour of buttons upon hovering
 - AngularJS is used to manage page routing, we also use it to make calls to the REST API and build custom directives
 - NPM is used to help manage some of the dependencies in the website
 - Bower is used to manage the installation of libraries and frameworks

## References

I installed the bower compontents for the Image Lightbox feature from http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/. I adapted a small part of the Javascript to make the lightbox image resize faster than the default value (changed 700ms to 300ms, see script.js line 16)
